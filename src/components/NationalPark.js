                  <p>Pronounced <strong><em>na&middot;tion&middot;al park</em></strong>, is defined as a scenic or historically important area of countryside protected by the federal government for the enjoyment of the general public or the preservation of wildlife.</p>
                  <p>There are over 400 national park sites in the United States. These places include parks, battlefields, monuments, seashores, historic sites, and recreation areas.</p>
                  <p>The National Park Service mission states, “The National Park Service preserves the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.” The arrowhead is the symbol for the National Park Service.
